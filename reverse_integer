leetcode link:https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-integer/
Explanation:- this is the basic maths problem which we solve n number of times but we dont look up the edges used 
descriptions of the edge cases:
1.check for negative sign
2. check for the constraint which is given in the code
-2**31 <= x <= 2**31 - 1
code:
class Solution(object):
    def reverse(self, x):
        sign = -1 if x<0 else 1
        x =abs(x)
        revNum = 0

        while x>0:
            ld = x%10
            revNum = (revNum*10) + ld
            x = x//10
        revNum *= sign

        if revNum < -2**31 or revNum > 2**31 - 1:
            return 0
        return revNum
